<p>A sheet of proof-solutions for the exercise on TFL <a href="/phi154/nd-with-derived-rules.pdf">natural deduction with derived rules</a>  are → <a href="/phi154/nd-derived-answers.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>One important caveat: these are only the solutions I happened to see first, and which seemed to me at least as efficient as other solutions I immediately saw. There are always many other solutions, and especially many other legitimate ways of ordering inferences. So, your answer that&rsquo;s quite unlike what I&rsquo;ve done isn&rsquo;t necessarily wrong! You might consider checking it with the <em>forall x</em>  <a href="http://proofs.openlogicproject.org">proof checker</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the first half of the questions are generally more difficult than the second half. And as I wrote out proofs for all of them, one of them, #14, seemed significantly more challenging than the others, at least with the <em>forall x</em> rule set.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  So, unlike the others, that is a more difficult one than I will put on your <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/phi154/notes/test-2/">second test</a> — at least in terms of my slightly subjective estimation of what&rsquo;s difficult!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s <em>not</em> more difficult if your rule set includes substitution rules for conditionals, turning on the equivalences between, first, “¬(P→Q)” and “P∧¬Q” and then also between “P→Q” and “¬P∨Q.” But the <em>forall x</em> rule set doesn&rsquo;t allow those substitutions. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
