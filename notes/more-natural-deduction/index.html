<p>A handful of students have asked for more TFL natural deduction proofs to practice.</p>
<h2 id="reference">Reference</h2>
<ol>
<li>If you want to display or print out a full list of the basic rules or derived rules for natural deduction, they are summarized in <em>forall x</em> at Appendix C 3.4 and 3.5. (In the Fall 2021 edition of the textbook, these start at page 406.)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sources-for-additional-tfl-natural-deduction-proofs-for-practicing">Sources for additional TFL natural deduction proofs for practicing</h2>
<ol>
<li>The textbook, <em>forall x</em>, contains many worked examples in the middle of the chapters (especially 16 and 17) which you can try and then compare to your own answers. There are also proofs at the end of each chapter which we didn&rsquo;t work (or which you may want to revisit as you gain skill).</li>
<li><em>forall x</em> Chapter 19 (ex. A,B) on pages 171–172 offers 8 additional arguments to prove.</li>
<li><a href="nd-with-biconditionals.pdf">A set of 15 proofs</a> I&rsquo;ve assigned in the past but not this year (using only rules R, ∧I, ∧E, →I, →E, ↔I, ↔E).</li>
<li>The <a href="nd-with-derived-rules.pdf">natural deduction with dervied rules</a> exercise sheet contains about 40 natural deduction proofs I didn&rsquo;t assign. Though derived rules are, by definition, never required for a proof, you may find it useful to use rules DS, DeM, MT, and DNE for these.</li>
<li>A good, slightly challenging exercise is to prove all four of the DeMorgan&rsquo;s equivalences. We did one in class. Note that one of the four is more challenging than the other three. The answers to two of them are at <em>forall x</em> 20.6.</li>
<li>Prove the other derived rules (MT, DNE, DS) or X. See Chapter 20.</li>
<li>There are 15 arguments to prove, with answers, at <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jks/LogicNotes/exercises3.html">this Australian National University site</a>. (Note their use of lower-case letters for atomic sentences. Change them to capitals when you practice them.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.logicmatters.net/ifl/ifl2-exercises-and-answers-2/">This set</a> of exercises and answers from <em>Logic Matters</em>, has useful proofs at 20(a), 21(a), and 22(a). Also the ones in 23(a) are theorems, meaning sentences you can try to prove without premises.</li>
