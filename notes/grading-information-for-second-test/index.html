<h2 id="accessing-your-second-test-grades">Accessing your second test grades</h2>
<p>Your second test grades, together with an image of your graded test are on Gradescope. Look for an email from Gradescope including a link to your test. Let me know if you have any problems.</p>
<p>For many of the test questions, I have included a grading rubric and sometimes grading notes.</p>
<h2 id="calculating-your-second-test-grade">Calculating your Second Test grade</h2>
<p>Our second/final logic test contained ten main questions (some with subparts) and each was worth the same number of points. I have treated those main questions as worth eight points each.</p>
<p>So, the total number of possible points for this test is (10 questions x 8 points =) 80.</p>
<p>But as always you should <em>not</em> calculate your grade by converting your grade fraction to a hundred-point scale or similar. The way to calculate your grade is as follows:</p>
<p>To convert an 80-point test to a 4-point scale, divide your score by 20 (because 80/20 = 4).</p>
<p>So, for example, if you earned 40 points out of 80 possible points, you would divide by 40 by 20 to get 2. And that would be equivalent to the grade of 2.0 out of 4.0, which is equivalent to a middle-C. (On a hundred-point scale, 40/80 would therefore be equivalent to 75, <em>not 50</em>.)</p>
<h2 id="test-statistics">Test statistics</h2>
<p>Some students are interested to know how the test was graded in the senes of the overall score distribution across all the tests. I will share with you the 25th and 75th percentile scores; together those delineate the range of the middle 50% of tests.</p>
<p>The half of the tests with grades in the middle 50% ranged from M to N points. They  therefore ranged from O to P on a 4-point scale, and from Q to R on Hofstra&rsquo;s letter grade scale. A quarter of the tests were below middle 50% range, and a quarter were above it.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-of-your-second-test-to-your-final-grade">Relationship of your second test to your final grade</h2>
<p>The second test is worth 25% of your final grade. A strong final test can weigh slightly more heavily than 25%, however, if it indicates that you ultimately learned some things that were shaky for you earlier in the course.</p>
<h2 id="final-remark">Final remark</h2>
<p>You worked hard on this test and this course; you should feel proud of that! I hope you also learned some things in the course that you will think about in the future.</p>
