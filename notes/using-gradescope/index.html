</div>

<main>
<p>Gradescope is an elegant online-grading web-application that Hofstra subscribes to. I use it for grading some assignments and all quizzes and tests for this course because it has at least these virtues:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can grade without knowing whose work I&rsquo;m grading, which helps make sure I&rsquo;m not bringing in unconscious biases.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s easy for you to see how I&rsquo;ve graded your work. In some cases I can include short explanations.</li>
<li>Some assignments can even be automatically graded.</li>
<li>It makes collecting and returning your graded work efficient.</li>
<li>I can grade question by question instead of test by test, by grading everyone&rsquo;s Question 1 and then everyone&rsquo;s Question 2, and so forth.</li>
<li>Other neat features.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can access Gradescope through Canvas. On the menu bar on the left side, you should see &ldquo;Gradescope.&rdquo; If you click through, you should be able to see a list of active assignments. Gradescope will already know who you are because you are logged into Canvas.</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for <a href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/5d3ifaeqi4-student-canvas">&ldquo;Using Gradescope with Canvas as a Student&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>I have used Gradescope for a couple semesters, but I am still getting to know it. Though it&rsquo;s overall very straightforward, I cannot see what the access-experience looks like for students. So, if there&rsquo;s anything you find confusing or not obvious, please let me know what that is so I can include some instructions for others here. <em>Thanks!</em></p>
