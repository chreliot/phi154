<h1 id="about-this-site">About this site</h1>
<p>This site is for the PHI 154 “Introduction to Symbolic Logic” course (Fall 2022) at Hofstra University.</p>
<h2 id="this-site-and-blackboard">This site and Blackboard</h2>
<p>In addition to this site, we will also use a Blackboard site. Blackboard is  available <a href="https://hofstra.blackboard.com">directly</a> or through the  <a href="https://my.hofstra.edu">Hofstra Portal</a>. Why use both? This site is easy for you to access and for me to publish to, whereas the Blackboard site can present password-protected information. Grades and material in copyright will therefore be available through Blackboard. There is a link to Blackboard at the top of this (and every) page, ↑.</p>
<h2 id="using-this-site">Using this site</h2>
<p>The landing page for this site is the Assignments calendar, because that is the page you will need to access most often. Look there for reading assignments and problem sets.</p>
<p>Everything else on the site is accessible through one of the shortcut buttons at the top. They lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Topics</strong>: A table of contents for the course, this running, numbered list includes all the content modules we will cover, added as we cover them. Some days we will finish as many as three or four. You should have your own notes for each topic; the numbering scheme should help you organize your notes. If you miss a session, make sure to get notes for each content item we covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handouts</strong>: A list of PDF handouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: A dated list of links to <em>ad hoc</em> notes I want to share with you (as opposed to course-content notes, which you will take yourself based on class sessions and presentations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: A selective list of pages and other things you might find useful or interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Syllabus</strong>: A PDF copy of the course syllabus will all the official information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blackboard</strong>: A link out to the Hofstra Blackboard site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>About</strong>: You Are Here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-blackboard">Using Blackboard</h2>
<p>Several kinds of things will appear on Blackboard. Look for the following in the menu list on the left.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Announcements</strong>: If I need to send you a timely announcement, I will post it as a Blackboard Announcement, and also check the box that has it sent automatically to your email. So, you&rsquo;ll find important announcements either by checking your email or by visiting Blackboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grades</strong>: Your grades will be visible under this button. (More details to follow.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Course Documents</strong>: If I need to share a copyrighted file that I can distribute to you legally only a closed site (as opposed to on the open web), it will be under this button. If it&rsquo;s something you need to read, you&rsquo;ll know that by looking at the Assignments page.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="share-things">Share things</h2>
<p>Think of anything that reminds you of what we&rsquo;re talking about in the course? Students sometimes send me course-related things others might enjoy seeing. Please feel welcome to share. It&rsquo;s straightforward for me to add a <a href="https://chreliot.github.io/phi154/tags/notes/">note</a> or a topic-page link.</p>
